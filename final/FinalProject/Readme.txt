Welcome to my prototype TTRPG DM Organizer.

This tool is designed to streamline keeping track of NPCs, notable monsters, and key items.
Players can also use it to give their allies an overview of their character and abilities,
without divulging all their secrets the way a full character sheet would.

When you first load the tool, you'll need to create a new party and the GM for it.
Once you do that, you can select it from the Party Menu and either log in as the GM or add player accounts.

FOR PLAYERS
When you create a new player, you'll begin with creating your character. What is their name? What level are they?
What are significant things about them? This information will be visible to your allies and the GM, as well as your
abilities and what important items you hold.

Once you log in, you can view your party, including your shared item stash. Selecting an ally shows you their details;
selecting the stash allows you to retrieve items from it. You can also view your own personal character. From this screen,
you can update your character's details, including their name, description, and level. You can also add abilities
that you'd like your allies to know about. You can also see the items your character is holding,
and place them in the party stash.

You can also change the password you use to log in here.

FOR GMS
You have access to the same Party Menu as the players, where you can see their characters, and what's in their stash.
You can take items from their stash and unassign them from here. You can change your password the same way they can, as well.

The rest of your menus are different. The NPC menu and Monster menu allow you to access NPCs and monsters you've created,
respectively, or add new ones. Once you have one, you can select it from the menu to edit it, or give it an item to hold on to,
much like how players can update their characters.

Your last main menu is the Item Menu, where you can create and distribute Key Items that hold importance in your story.
Once you've created an item, you can select it here to either update it, or assign it to a monster, NPC or the Party stash.
From the stash, the players can share it amongst themselves.
